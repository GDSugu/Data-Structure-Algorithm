âœ… **1) Handle Edge Case First:**  
   - If `k <= 1`, return `0` immediately since no positive subarray product can be less than `k`.  

âœ… **2) Expand the Window:**  
   - Multiply `product` by `nums[right]` while expanding the window to the right.  

âœ… **3) Shrink the Window When Needed:**  
   - If `product >= k`, shrink the window by dividing `product` by `nums[left]` and increment `left`.  

âœ… **4) Update Count:**  
   - Add `right - left + 1` to `count` for every valid window, since all subarrays ending at `right` are valid.
