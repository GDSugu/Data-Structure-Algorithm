If the interviewer asks **"Is recursion and backtracking the same?"**, you should give a **concise, structured, and confident** answer. 
Hereâ€™s how you can **answer step by step**:

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Start with a Clear Definition**
ðŸ“Œ *"Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem. 
    Backtracking is a specialized form of recursion that explores all possible solutions and undoes decisions when they lead to a dead end."*

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Highlight the Key Difference**
ðŸ“Œ *"The key difference is that recursion **solves problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems**, 
    while backtracking **tries different possibilities and backtracks when it finds an invalid solution**."*

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Give a Quick Example**
ðŸ‘‰ **Recursion Example (Factorial Calculation)**:
*"If I want to calculate the factorial of a number, I use recursion by multiplying `n * factorial(n-1)` until I reach 1."*

ðŸ‘‰ **Backtracking Example (Solving a Maze)**:
*"If I want to find a path in a maze, I use backtracking by exploring a path, and if I hit a wall, I backtrack and try a different path."*

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Show Their Relationship**
ðŸ“Œ *"Backtracking uses recursion, but not all recursive solutions involve backtracking."*

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Conclusion (Interviewer-Friendly Closing)**
ðŸ“Œ *"So, while both use function calls and a base case, recursion **solves problems by breaking them down**, 
     while backtracking **explores all possibilities and backtracks when needed**."*

### **ðŸ”¥ Bonus (If the Interviewer Asks for Applications)**
| Recursion Example | Backtracking Example |
|------------------|------------------|
| Fibonacci Sequence | N-Queens Problem |
| Tree Traversal (DFS) | Sudoku Solver |
| Factorial Calculation | Word Search in a Grid |

---

### **ðŸš€ Final Answer in a Single Sentence**
*"Recursion is a problem-solving technique where a function calls itself, while backtracking is a type of recursion that explores all possible solutions and backtracks when an invalid path is encountered."*
