That’s a great plan! **Recursion and Backtracking** are essential for solving complex problems efficiently, especially in **interview coding rounds** at top product-based companies. Since you’re focusing on this topic first, here’s a **structured roadmap** to **master Recursion & Backtracking** step by step.  

---

### **🔹 Step 1: Start with a Clear Definition**
📌 *"Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem. 
    Backtracking is a specialized form of recursion that explores all possible solutions and undoes decisions when they lead to a dead end."*

## **🔥 Step-by-Step Approach to Master Recursion & Backtracking**
### **Step 1: Master Recursion Basics**
Before diving into backtracking, **you need a strong foundation in recursion**.  

✅ **Understand the three steps in recursion:**  
1️⃣ **Base Case** – When to stop recursion?  
2️⃣ **Recursive Case** – How to break the problem into smaller subproblems?  
3️⃣ **Recurrence Relation** – How does the function call itself?  

📌 **Key Concepts to Cover:**  
- Factorial using recursion (**Leetcode 509**)  
- Fibonacci using recursion (**Leetcode 70**)  
- Sum of digits of a number using recursion  
- Print numbers from 1 to N using recursion  

Once you are comfortable with recursion, move on to **Backtracking**.

## **🔥 Step 2: Backtracking Concepts**
✅ **Understand the three rules of Backtracking:**  
1️⃣ **Try a possible option**  
2️⃣ **Recurse for the next decision**  
3️⃣ **Undo (Backtrack) the previous choice if it leads to failure**  

📌 **Pattern to follow in Backtracking Problems:**  
- **Base Condition** (When to stop)  
- **Make a choice** (Pick an element or move in a direction)  
- **Recursion call** (Move to the next step)  
- **Backtrack (Undo choice)**

## **🔥 Step 3: Solve Core Backtracking Problems**
These are the most **frequently asked** interview problems in **FAANG**.

### **1️⃣ Subsets (Leetcode 78)**
💡 **Concepts Covered:**  
- Generating **all possible subsets** of a given array.  
- Using **recursion** and **backtracking**.  

🔹 **Example Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
🔹 **Output:** `[[], [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3]]`  

👉 **Why is this important?**  
- This is the **foundation of backtracking**.  
- Helps understand how to explore **all possibilities** using recursion.

---

### **2️⃣ Combination Sum (Leetcode 39)**
💡 **Concepts Covered:**  
- Choosing **a subset of numbers** whose sum equals a target.  
- Handling **duplicates** and avoiding unnecessary calculations.  

🔹 **Example Input:** `candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7`  
🔹 **Output:** `[[2,2,3],[7]]`  

👉 **Why is this important?**  
- This problem introduces **pruning the recursion tree** to optimize backtracking.  
- Helps with understanding how **combinations** work.  

---

### **3️⃣ Permutations (Leetcode 46)**
💡 **Concepts Covered:**  
- Generating **all possible arrangements** of numbers.  
- Handling **duplicate numbers** carefully.  

🔹 **Example Input:** `nums = [1,2,3]`  
🔹 **Output:** `[[1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2,1,3], [2,3,1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1]]`  

👉 **Why is this important?**  
- This teaches how to **swap elements** for permutations.  
- Important for **anagram and sequence problems**.

---

### **4️⃣ Word Search (Leetcode 79)**
💡 **Concepts Covered:**  
- **Backtracking with 2D grids.**  
- Exploring multiple paths to **find a target word** in a matrix.  

🔹 **Example Input:**  
```
board = [["A","B","C","E"],
         ["S","F","C","S"],
         ["A","D","E","E"]]
word = "ABCCED"
```
🔹 **Output:** `true`  

👉 **Why is this important?**  
- This introduces **grid-based backtracking**, which is common in real-world applications.

## **🔥 Step 4: Advanced Backtracking Topics**
Once you’re comfortable with the core problems, tackle **more complex** problems.

### ✅ **Backtracking on Grids**
- **Rat in a Maze Problem**
- **N-Queens Problem (Leetcode 51)**
- **Sudoku Solver (Leetcode 37)**

### ✅ **Backtracking with Pruning**
- **Palindrome Partitioning (Leetcode 131)**
- **Letter Combinations of a Phone Number (Leetcode 17)**
