/************************************** PARTITION LABELS *************************************************
 * Leetcode 763: https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/
 * 
 * 🔍 Goal: Partition string `s` into as many parts as possible 
 *         so that **each letter appears in only one part**.
 * 🧠 Strategy: Greedy + two-pointer (sliding window).
 * 
 * ✅ Notes to Remember:
 * - `map`: stores the **last occurrence** of each character.
 * - `left`: start of current window.
 * - `right`: end of current window (max of all characters' last positions in this window).
 * - When `i === right`:
 *     → all characters in this window are fully contained
 *     → push partition size and move `left = i + 1`
 * 
 * 🔁 Pattern: **Sliding window** defined by [left...right]
